	abstract = {The Galapagos Archipelago is nearly devoid of freshwater resources, but during six months of the year, a fog layer covers the windward slopes of the main islands. In order to investigate the hydrological importance of this phenomenon, a monitoring network was set up on Santa Cruz Island, at the center of the archipelago. Meteorological parameters were monitored together with throughfall and stemflow at two stations: a first in a secondary forest at the lowest fringe of the fog layer (400 m a.s.l.), and a second in shrub lands of the Galapagos National Park, at the center of the fog layer (650 m a.s.l.). Cloud water interception was quantified from the wet canopy water budget, based on a modified Rutter-type canopy interception model. This methodology allowed the estimation of fog interception for short time intervals (15 min) and avoided the subjective separation into individual rainfall events. Fog was found to be a negligible water input at the lower site, but was estimated at 26 ± 16\% of incident rainfall at the higher site. Wind was shown to enhance fog interception, but this alone could not explain the difference in fog catch between the two sites. Higher liquid water content and more frequent fog occurrence contributed to the difference as well. This study highlights that the presence of fog may induce a marked increase of net precipitation, but this effect is restricted to the summit areas exposed to winds, located in the center of the cloud belt.},
